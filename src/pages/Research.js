    <p>Humanityâ€™s return to the Moon is the foundation for a sustained presence beyond Earth. To make this possible, we need robust lunar infrastructure that supports frequent landings, launches, and logistics operations.</p>
    <p>In the short term, the lunar spaceport will serve as the heart of this network: not just a launch and landing site, but a platform for scientific research and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). Designing such a complex facility requires balancing environmental challenges, engineering demands, and operational needs.</p>
