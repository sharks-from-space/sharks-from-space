        "\t1. Deployable and temporary LLPs for rapid, movable early-mission use.",
        "\t2. Prepare a high-bearing-capacity subgrade by lowering the surface to a particular depth, then paving it with regolith bricks to create durability (ISRU-built LLP).",
        "Space radiation poses major risks to crews, electronics, and infrastructure. A sustainable approach combines lightweight alloys and hydrogen-rich polymers with regolith-based shielding, which can be compacted or enriched with additives like polyethylene or water to improve protection.",

        "Robotics will be central to building and operating a lunar spaceport. Autonomous and semi-autonomous systems can handle tasks such as cargo offloading, mobility, and construction, reducing crew workload and mission risk."

Challenges include cryogenic storage at 20 K and boil-off; solutions involve Zero-Boil-Off tanks, advanced composites, and possible ammonia synthesis as a safer, more stable hydrogen carrier.",

        "\tLiability & Ownership: We propose a hybrid liability model: strict liability for high-risk launches and fault-based liability for broader operations. Since lunar land cannot be owned, our credit-based system offers investment rewards and operational privileges without violating international law.",
        "\tEconomics: Our analysis estimates initial pad construction at $4 billion, with launch/landing fees (~$20â€“30M per mission) forming the core revenue stream. Breakeven requires 15â€“20 launches per year, supplemented by ISRU propellant sales, cargo handling, and tourism. A publicâ€“private partnership model ensures financial sustainability and growth.",
