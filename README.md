# Sharks from Space

We’re participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge: Sharks from Space!

Using Earth observation data, we explore how satellite measurements of ocean currents, temperature, and plankton can help track shark movements and identify foraging hotspots. As Jawstronauts, we combine this data with tagging insights to better understand and protect these incredible apex predators.
